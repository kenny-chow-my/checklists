Research by the Software Engineering Institute suggests that programmers make 15-20 common mistakes. By adding 
such mistakes to a checklist, you can make sure that you spot them whenever they occur and help drive them out over time.

The following is an example checklist of questions that can be asked during a code review. This should be considered
a starting point for creating a checklist for your team.

## Code Review Checklist

### General

* Does the code work? Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.
* Is all the code easily understood?
* Does it conform to your agreed coding conventions? These will usually cover location of braces, variable and function names, line length, indentations, formatting, and comments.
* Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
* Is the code as modular as possible?
* Can any global variables be replaced?
* Is there any commented out code?
* Do loops have a set length and correct termination conditions?
* Do the names used in the program convey intent?

### Performance

* Are there any obvious optimizations that will improve performance?
* Can any of the code be replaced with library or built-in functions?
* Can any logging or debugging code be removed?

### Security

* Are all data inputs checked (for the correct type, length, format, and range) and encoded?
* Where third-party utilities are used, are returning errors being caught?
* Are output values checked and encoded?
* Are invalid parameter values handled?

### Documentation

* Do comments exist and describe the intent of the code?
* Are all functions commented?
* Is any unusual behavior or edge-case handling described?
* Is the use and function of third-party libraries documented?
* Are data structures and units of measurement explained?
* Is there any incomplete code? If so, should it be removed or flagged with a suitable marker like ‘TODO’?

### Testing

* Is the code testable? The code should be structured so that it doesn't add too many or hide dependencies, is unable to initialize objects, test frameworks can use methods etc.
* Do tests exist, and are they comprehensive? 
* Do unit tests actually test that the code is performing the intended functionality?
* Could any test code be replaced with the use of an existing API?
